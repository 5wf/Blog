Because of my <a href="http://code-inside.de/blog-in/2011/08/23/entrance-into-git-for-net-developer/">latest fun</a> with Git I’ve planned to connect it with the CI Tool of my choice. So what do I have to do if I want TeamCity to bring me the latest Sources?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>In fact it’s very easy…</strong>

<strong> </strong>

In the latest <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">Version of TeamCity (at the moment it’s 6.5)</a> the Git-Client is already installed. It’s not necessary to do some SSH configuration or some magic stuff like that – at least not for taking open repositories only.

Important: Instead of declaring the HTTP address (like you know it from several SVN hosts) you need to declare the GIT Adress:

What’s left could stay at default. Sometimes things are not that difficult.
