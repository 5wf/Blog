<p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p>Like <a href="http://code-inside.de/blog-in/2011/06/27/microsoft-full-speed-ahead-into-the-cloud-with-fileupload-node-js/">if assumed a while ago</a> Microsoft does everything to place Windows Azure as “the” Cloud-Platform for several Languages &amp; Frameworks. In the past Microsoft was famous for pushing their own Platforms and Languages into the market seems like changing their strategy and is now pushing for example <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure">publishes SDKs on GitHub</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Node.js on Windows Azure</strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p>Windows Azure <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/">provides node.js</a>! The SDK includes <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh689725(VS.103).aspx">Powershell-Cmdlets</a> for creating and testing and deploying of node.js applications and samples.</p>  <p><strong>Never worked with node.js so far? Samples from Microsoft </strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p>Since now I was only able to look casually above <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> by myself but it seems like the examples from Microsoft are very large comparing to the numerous “Hello World” article but without getting to complex. The first <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/tutorials/web-app-with-express/">Tutorial</a> includes:</p>  <p>- IISNode for node.js based on IIS</p>  <p>- How to work with the Node-Package manager “npm”</p>  <p>- How this works with the Azure services</p>  <p>- MVC Framework “Express”</p>  <p>For a totally node.js inexperienced developer like me it looks very well and understandable. At last it doesn’t hurt to <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/tutorials/web-app-with-express/">take a look</a>.</p>  <p>There are also two tutorials which are a little bit more complex: <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/tutorials/getting-started/">Node.js Web Application with Table Storage</a></p>  <p><strong>Entrance video in 5 minutes with node.js &amp; Azure:</strong></p> <iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Windows-Azure-Developer-Experience-Videos/Nodejs-Windows-Azure-Introduction/player?w=512&amp;h=288" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Node.js – a curious hype?</strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p>I’m sure node.js is used to be fun with a few elegant frameworks. I didn’t get far with C# alone as well. Only the frameworks like ASP.NET MVC make it interesting and because of this I’m curious about the development and we should wait for whatever will come.</p>  <p>Anyway Microsoft is on the right way.</p>  <p>All the samples from Microsoft are also available on GitHub.</p>  <p><a href="http://code-inside.de/blog-in/wp-content/uploads/image1425.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image1425" border="0" alt="image1425" src="http://code-inside.de/blog-in/wp-content/uploads/image1425_thumb.png" width="145" height="140" /></a></p>
