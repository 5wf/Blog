I think this is a nice thing but in fact I can´t remember when I used REAL UML at work.So I asked myself, do we really need UML?</p>  
  
  <p><b>yUML</b></p>  
  <p><a href="http://yuml.me/">yUML.me</a> is a cool service to create <a href="http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/samples">classes</a>, <a href="http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/activity/draw">activities</a> &amp; <a href="http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/usecase/draw">Use case</a> UML diagrams. There is also a version for companies. A great idea and the diagrams are quite good looking. <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Zwinkerndes Smiley" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/wp-images-en/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile13.png" /></p>
<p><b>Do I need UML?</b></p>
<p>In my (short) time as a software developer I never felled the pressure to create difficult UML diagrams. Most of the time I paint classes or Use case diagrams or stuff like that on our whiteboard or on powerpoint. </p>
<p><b>Powerpoint-architect </b></p>  
  <p><a href="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/wp-images-en/image126.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="left" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/wp-images-en/image_thumb35.png" width="240" height="117" /></a>Although powerpoint isn´t the first choice for software architecture I remember more powerpoint blocks about the architecture of software than "real" UML Diagrams. </p>
<p><b>Notice</b></p>  
  <p><a href="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/wp-images-en/image127.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="left" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/wp-images-en/image_thumb36.png" width="181" height="240" /></a>I didn´t finish a study, just an apprenticeship. During my apprenticeship I liked UML but in my opinion it´s oversized. Just take a look on the "Syntax" (what´s the direction of the arrow? "extend" or "include"?) In most cases simple but effective paintings are enough. But I know some students who are in love with UML because it´s well-structured but is this really that important?</p>  
  
  <p><b>UML vs. TDD?</b></p>  
  <p>A while ago I read a book with a comparison between UML and a construction plan for house building. The main argument was, that for building a house you need an entire construction plan because it takes more time to build and rebuild a house than making a plan. But in my opinion it´s not the same in software architecture. It just takes a few hours to find out if this will work or not. TDD (test driven design) is the best way especially if I plan to build an API. Making an UML plan will take the same time than testing this in a TDD session.</p>
<p><b>UML is getting old fast </b></p>  
  <p>I affirm that a UML diagram is getting old soon after you created it with a lot of work. Without a strict process that makes sure that the UML diagram is conforming to reality you do it better if you save the work or not?</p>
<p><b>A good architecture should fit on a napkin</b></p>  
  <p>That´s a quote from Ralf Westphal who wrote an interesting Blogpost about this subject (I´m sorry it´s only available in German). I share his opinion ;)</p>
<p><b>     <br /></b></p>  
  <p><b>Result</b></p>
<p>I wouldn´t say that UML is useless but I never used it in one of my projects. If you create it in a nice graphic way (like for example in VS 2010) than it could be interesting of course. Without tooling it´s too complicated for me. So all in all yUML is a good idea but without the write tooling I´m going on painting powerpoint architecture on the white board <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smiley" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/wp-images-en/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>But what is your opinion? Do you use UML? Why? How did you keep this actually? Am I crazy and can´t see all the advantages?</strong></p>
