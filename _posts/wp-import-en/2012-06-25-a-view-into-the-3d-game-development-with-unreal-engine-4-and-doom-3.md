<p>Properly a look behind the curtains of game development or maybe a first try was the entry to software development for several developers. I’m a developer for Business- and Web-applications but I’m always fascinated by game development – especially since the dreaded math-knowledge plays an important role in these fields more than in web-App development.</p>  

<p><b>Unreal Engine 4 – impressing Engine + IDE</b></p>  

<p>At the moment Epic is working on the Unreal Engine 4 and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZmRt8gCsC0&amp;feature=relmfu">offers a Tech-Demo</a> for this. More interesting for developer are the tools Epic offers to the game-developers:</p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:abf408c7-2aae-42a8-9287-2fe72ce772ea" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div><object width="448" height="252"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MOvfn1p92_8?hl=en&amp;hd=1"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MOvfn1p92_8?hl=en&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" height="252"></embed></object></div></div>
<p>Most impressing scenes in my opinion:</p>
<p>4:48: direct skip to the designer.</p>
<p>9:40: skip from the designer to Visual Studio. </p>
<p>Also the debugging of the “Events” around Minute 7 reminds me of my daily business. All in all I recommend the whole video!</p>
<p>It’s ironical that there are more powerful Tools for difficult 3D Engines then for simple .NET Web-Apps with data bank. <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Zwinkerndes Smiley" src="{{BASE_PATH}}/assets/wp-images-en/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile40.png" /></p>  

<p><b>Doom 3 Source Code – Review</b></p>
<p>Some time ago I’ve already blogged about the Source Code Release on <a href="https://github.com/id-Software">GitHub (Quake, Doom and so on) of several id-Software</a>. To get into the Source Code needs either a lot of experience or a lot of time. Fabien Sanglard has published a 6-parts <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php">Review about the Doom 3 Source Code</a>.</p>
<p>In the review he talks about the different main components and describe them. He also recommends some books and links for those who would like to know more about 3D development.</p>
<p><b>A look beyond one’s own nose</b></p>  

<p>I recommend every gamer and (not gamer-) developer to take a look into this world – you are going to learn more about this way of development and maybe you get some inspirations for modern Web-applications. </p>
