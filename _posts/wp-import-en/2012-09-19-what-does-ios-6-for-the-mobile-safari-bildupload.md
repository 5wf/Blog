You are able to download iOS 6 from the Apple Developer side and there are growing numbers of reports about it. The most interesting part for me: What is new on Safari?

Probably the most important update: &lt;input type= ‘file’/&gt; will be supported from now on! At least you are now able to upload pictures and videos.

Tait Brown <a href="http://taitems.tumblr.com/post/24936855546/what-ios-6-mobile-safari-offers-front-end-devs">published</a> a list of all the updates from the “web development” point of view.

There is also a video about how the iOS 6 Safari will look like for the user including a Buildupload. The Video is from <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/06/12/ios-6-safari-video-demonstration/">this webpage</a>.
