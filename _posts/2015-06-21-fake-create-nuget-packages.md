The first approach is that you define a NuSpec-Template and fill the missing pieces during the build via FAKE. This scenario is covered [here](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/create-nuget-package.html).The second on is "simpler", at least for me (but... you know... I have no idea how to write real F# code):You just need to manage your .nuspec manually. Currently I use this approach, because I can handle everything inside the .nuspec files and can still use FAKE for the build process.## Project OverviewThe sample project consists of one class library project and the .fsx file. ![x]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/md-images/2015-06-21/project.png "Project Overview")The __.nuspec__ content:    <?xml version="1.0"?>    <package >    	<metadata>        <id>Test.Foobar</id>        <version>2.0.0</version>        <title>Test Foobar</title>        <authors>Code Inside Team</authors>        <owners>Code Inside Team</owners>        <licenseUrl>http://blog.codeinside.eu</licenseUrl>        <projectUrl>http://blog.codeinside.eu</projectUrl>        <requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance>        <description>Hello World</description>        <releaseNotes>        </releaseNotes>        <copyright>Copyright 2015</copyright>        <tags></tags>      </metadata>      <files>        <file src="CreateNuGetViaFake.dll" target="lib\net45" />      </files>    </package>Important here are the required NuSpec meta fields and the files section. If you are not familiar with the [.nuspec syntax, take a look at the reference](http://docs.nuget.org/create/nuspec-reference).	## The FAKE scriptNow to the FAKE script. At the end of the post you will see a link to the complete script, but I will highlight the "important" parts:__Building the library__    ...    let artifactsBuildDir = "./artifacts/build/"    ...    Target "BuildApp" (fun _ ->       trace "Building App..."       !! "**/*.csproj"         |> MSBuildRelease artifactsBuildDir "Build"         |> Log "AppBuild-Output: "    )Nothing special - we just build the library and the output will be stored in our artifacts/build folder.__Building the NuGet package - with the correct version__    ...    let artifactsNuGetDir = @"./artifacts/nuget/"    let artifactsBuildDir = "./artifacts/build/"    ...	    Target "BuildNuGet" (fun _ ->               let doc = System.Xml.Linq.XDocument.Load("./CreateNuGetViaFake/Test.nuspec")        let vers = doc.Descendants(XName.Get("version", doc.Root.Name.NamespaceName))             NuGet (fun p ->         {p with            Version = (Seq.head vers).Value            OutputPath = artifactsNuGetDir            WorkingDir = artifactsBuildDir            })  "./CreateNuGetViaFake/Test.nuspec"    )The built-in [NuGetHelper](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/fake-nugethelper.html) will invoke nuget.exe with the given nuspec. We set the WorkingDir to the output of the other target and set the OutputPath to another location. The version handling is a bit complicated, because of this [issue](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE/issues/830). The default Version is 1.0.0 and FAKE will currently ignore the Version-Information inside the .nuspec.The workaround is: Parse the .nuspec and get the version number and pass it to the NuGetHelper. Easy, right?__ Make sure you include System.Xml.Linq__To get things running you will need to reference System.Xml.Linq like this:    // include Fake lib    #r "packages/FAKE/tools/FakeLib.dll"    #r "System.Xml.Linq"    open Fake    open System.Xml.Linq        RestorePackages()__The result: Our NuGet Package__![x]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/md-images/2015-06-21/result.png "The Result: Our NuGet Package")## Discover the NuGetHelper or Paket for more optionsThe [NuGetHelper](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/fake-nugethelper.html) from FAKE has some pretty nice functionality built-in, for example you can publish to NuGet.org with a given access key.For a more complete solution around consuming and creating NuGet Packages take a look at [Paket](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/).For my simple use cases FAKE was "good enough" and I hope this might help.You can find the complete [sample & build script on GitHub](https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/tree/master/2015/CreateNuGetViaFake).
