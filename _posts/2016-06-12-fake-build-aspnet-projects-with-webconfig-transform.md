## What's the difference between a ASP.NET and other projects?

The most obvious difference is that the output is a bunch of dlls and content files. Additionally you might have a __web.debug.config or web.release.config__ in your source folder. 
Both files are important, because they are used during a Visual-Studio build as a [__Web.Config Transformation__](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd465326(v=vs.110).aspx)

With a normal build the transformation will not kick in... so we need a way to trigger the transformation.

## Project Overview

The sample project consists of one ASP.NET project and the .fsx file.

## The FAKE script

We reuse the MSBuild-Helper from FAKE and inject a couple of "Publish"-related stuff, which will trigger the transformation.

__Publish a ASP.NET project__

    ...
    Target "BuildWebApp" (fun _ ->
    trace "Building WebHosted Connect..."
    !! "**/*.csproj"
     |> MSBuild artifactsBuildDir "Package"
        ["Configuration", "Release"
         "Platform", "AnyCPU"
         "_PackageTempDir", (@"..\" + artifactsDir + @"Release-Ready-WebApp")
         ]
     |> Log "AppBuild-Output: "
    )
    ...
	
## Result

![x]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/md-images/2016-06-12/output.png "Output")

This build will produce two artifacts - the build-folder just contains the normal build output, but __without__ a web.config transformation. 

The other folder contains a ready to deploy web application, __with the web.config applied__.

You can find the complete [sample & build script on GitHub](https://github.com/Code-Inside/Samples/tree/master/2016/LetsUseFake-AspNet).
