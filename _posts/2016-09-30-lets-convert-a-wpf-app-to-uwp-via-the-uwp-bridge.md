## Project Centennial - running desktop apps in the UWP world

Last year Microsoft revealed the plans to run and distribute desktop apps (basically all apps ever written for Windows) in the Universal-Windows-Platform "universe". The project titel was ["Project Centennial"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=51691) and a year later the tooling seems to be ok-ish. So, let's try something simple and convert a simple WPF app to UWP.

## Limitations with this approach

Be aware that even if you can "convert" your WPF app this way you will get a UWP-ish app. The executable will only run __on a normal Windows Desktop System__. The app will __not work on a Windows Phone, Xbox or HoloLens__ - at least not now.

Also keep in mind that certain operations might fail and that the outcome of some operations might suprise you. The app itself will run in a kind of sandbox. Calls to the file system or registry will be faked. Details can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes).

As far as I know from a couple of hours playing around:

* Changes to the Registry will not leak out of the sandbox, but for the app it will be seen as ok and is persistent
* Changes to Well-Known-Folders (e.g. %AppData%) will not leak out of the sandbox, but for the app it will be seen as ok and is persistent
* Some operation can leak out to the actual desktop, e.g. start another programm.

## The Desktop App Converter

If you have an existing installer or setup you might want to take a look at the [desktop app converter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-run-desktop-app-converter. This utility will convert the installer to a UWP package. 

[A quick walk through can be found on Mike Taultys blog](https://mtaulty.com/2016/09/29/a-quick-skip-through-the-desktop-app-converter/).

## Step by Step - from WPF source to UWP app

The important steps from the WPF app to a UWP app are also [documented in the MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion).

But let's start with a __simple WPF app (running on .NET 4.6.1)__ - this is the MainWindow.xaml

    <Window x:Class="WpfToUwpTestApp.MainWindow"
            xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
            xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
            xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
            xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfToUwpTestApp"
            mc:Ignorable="d"
            Title="MainWindow - WpfToUwpTestApp" Height="350" Width="525">
        <StackPanel>
            <Button Height="100" Width="100" Click="Button_Click1">Write in Registry</Button>
            <Button Height="100" Width="100" Click="Button_Click2">Write in AppData</Button>
            <Button Height="100" Width="100" Click="Button_Click3">Open HTTP Address</Button>
    
        </StackPanel>
    </Window>

The code behind:

    public partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Button_Click1(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            RegistryKey key = Registry.CurrentUser.OpenSubKey("Software", true);

            key.CreateSubKey("WpfToUwpTestApp");
            key = key.OpenSubKey("WpfToUwpTestApp", true);


            key.CreateSubKey("ItWorks");
            key = key.OpenSubKey("ItWorks", true);

            key.SetValue("ItWorks", "true");
        }

        private void Button_Click2(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            string roaming = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData);

            string appFolder = System.IO.Path.Combine(roaming, "WpfToUwpTestApp");

            string file = System.IO.Path.Combine(appFolder, "Test.txt");

            if (Directory.Exists(appFolder) == false)
            {
                Directory.CreateDirectory(appFolder);
            }

            File.WriteAllText(file, "Hello World!");
        }

        private void Button_Click3(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            Process.Start("http://www.google.com");
        }
    }
	
Pretty simple, right? Those three operations came just to my mind. In general I wouldn't use the Registry at all, but I had a use case in mind where I need to access the Registry.

I also added a couple of dummy store images (from the default UWP app project template) - my solution looks like this:

![x]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/md-images/2016-09-30/sln.png "Solution")

When we build the .csproj the output should look like this:

* WpfToUwpTestApp.exe
* appxmanifest.xml
* Assets/StoreLogo.png
* Assets/Square150x150Logo.scale-200.png
* Assets/Square44x44Logo.scale-200.png

## The appmanifest.xml

The next step is to create the __appmanifest.xml__ - on the [MSDN there is a handy template](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-manual-conversion). The Desktop App Converter does the same thing and tries to create this file automatically, but it's not that hard to set it by hand:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Package
       xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10"
       xmlns:uap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10"
       xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities">
      <Identity Name="WpfToUwpTestApp"
        ProcessorArchitecture="x64"
        Publisher="CN=Robert"
        Version="1.0.0.0" />
      <Properties>
        <DisplayName>WpfToUwpTestApp</DisplayName>
        <PublisherDisplayName>Robert</PublisherDisplayName>
        <Description>No description entered</Description>
        <Logo>Assets/StoreLogo.png</Logo>
      </Properties>

      </Resources>
      <Dependencies>
        <TargetDeviceFamily Name="Windows.Desktop" MinVersion="10.0.14316.0" MaxVersionTested="10.0.14316.0" />
      </Dependencies>
      <Capabilities>
        <rescap:Capability Name="runFullTrust"/>
      </Capabilities>
      <Applications>
        <Application Id="Test" Executable="WpfToUwpTestApp.exe" EntryPoint="Windows.FullTrustApplication">
          <uap:VisualElements
           BackgroundColor="#464646"
           DisplayName="WpfToUwpTestApp"
           Square150x150Logo="Assets/Square150x150Logo.scale-200.png"
           Square44x44Logo="Assets/Square44x44Logo.scale-200.png"
           Description="WpfUwpWriteInRegistry - Desc" />
        </Application>
      </Applications>
    </Package>
	
## Create the App.appx package

Now we are ready to create the appx package. You need the Windows 10 SDK to do this.

To simplify things, I copied the needed files from the build output to a folder called _App. 

To create the package, invoke the following command:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\makeappx.exe" pack -d "%~dp0_App" -p "%~dp0App.appx"

The result is a unsigned appx package called "App".
	
## Create a valid pfx (one time only)

In the following step we need a valid pfx to sign the package. For development you can use this command to create a pfx:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\makecert.exe" -r -h 0 -n "CN=Robert" -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 -pe -sv App.pvk App.cer 

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\pvk2pfx.exe" -pvk App.pvk -spc App.cer -pfx App.pfx -po apptest

After this you should see a "App.pfx" in the folder. I'm not 100% sure if this step is really needed, but I needed to do it, otherwise I couldn't install the app:

Now click on the pfx and enter the password "apptest" and import it in the "Trusted Root CAs":

![x]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/md-images/2016-09-30/trust.png "Importing the pfx")

## Sign App.appx

Now we need to sign the package and we are done:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\signtool.exe" sign /f "App.pfx" -fd SHA256 /p apptest "App.appx"
	
## Install the App!

Now you can double click on the appx package and the installer will show up:

![x]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/md-images/2016-09-30/install.png "install the app")

## Running the App

And there is our beauty:

![x]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/md-images/2016-09-30/app.png "running the app")

## Exploring the sandbox:

Remember our 3 methods? The results of those three calls are:

* Write to the Registry: Seems to work for the app, but (as expected) the registry value will not leak out of the "sandbox"
* Write to %appdata%: Seems to work for the app, but the data value will not leak out of the "sandbox"
* Open a browser: The default browser will be invoked for a HTTP url. 

It was my first try to convert a (simple) WPF app to UWP and the result is interesting. 

Hope my first steps in this world might help you!
